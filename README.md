### Calastone: 2018 – Present

Calastone does financial messaging, mostly routing mutual fund orders between distributors and fund managers. Their website would have you believe that they did blockchain.

Lots of maintenance programming, but highlights of my work otherwise include (nonexhaustive):

* Quickly becoming the top-performing engineer at production support by any measurable metric. Breakfix work and retrospective documentation.
* A custom OAuth2 implementation. I contributed to this and integrated it with several web frameworks.
* Multiple internal brownbag presentations sharing lessons from completed work.
* Meaningful contributions to a bespoke DSL interpreter that we were unfortunately stuck with.
* A comically resilient SwiftMx routing solution capable of processing hundreds of messages per second. We were forced to build this because we couldn’t convince the UK Market Practice Group to do things differently. I was the lead on this one.
* Mentoring several junior developers. Being mentored in “soft-skills” by a benevolent and long-suffering product manager.

### Dorset Software: 2016 – 2018

Various consultancy placements. Mainly building a bespoke data compression/transmission protocol to pull time-series data across a one-bit-per-second connection.

### 1st Class MMath Mathematics; The University of Sheffield: 2012 – 2016

Dissertation-type-thing on computational methods for archaeological statistics. Multivariate analysis done in R that got me into programming. Lots of group theory that I’ve subsequently forgotten.

### Big List of Buzzwords

* C#, .Net Framework (4.7.1 mostly), .Net Core (fair bit of 3.1), .Net (5, 6, 7).
* Web APIs.
* Microsoft Azure, including lots of use of AKS, KeyVault, and ASB.
* NServiceBus under duress.
* Docker, Kubernetes, Helm.
* T-SQL, SQL Server. No unforced ORM usage but if you insist I’ve used EntityFramework, NHibernate, and Dapper.
* Angular with Typescript. A bit of Knockout with Javascript. Razor and Blazor. ASP.Net Webforms. Believe it or not I’ve done literally all of these in the same frankenstein web application.
* WPF, WCF, WWF.
* Unit testing with nUnit and xUnit. UI testing with Selenium. Gherkin and NeoLoad when QA insisted.
* Teamcity, Github Actions.
* Git. I’ve used Subversion and TFS too but please don’t make me do it again.
* A little bit of Terraform, Chef, and Powershell, but I’m not an expert.
